    "For my final project, I will be helping to locate an Afghan restaurant in Toronto, Canada. I noticed in the Foursquare data used earlier in this course that there was a category for Afghan restaurants, and upon further research from the <a href=\"https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/afghan-canadians\">Canadian Encyclopedia</a> I discovered that many of Canada's 84,000 Afghans live in the Toronto area. As I did not, upon cursory notice, discover a plethora of Afghan restaurants in Toronto, I wondered if the area would be a good market for such a restaurant. Minority ethnic groups, especially recent migrants, often due not have access to the cuisines of their ancestral lands outside of their homes. Restaurants provide a cultural connection to food and foster a sense of community within a neighborhood. As such, this project will try to focus on finding the best area to open an Afghan restaurant for the growing Afghan-Canadian population. The target audience for this would be potential investors or restauranteurs who are looking to \n",

    "##### Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "The question I will be exploring is: <i>Is Toronto a good market for an Afghan restaurant? What neighborhood would best support such a restaurant?</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data to be used in Collection and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this I will use data from the following sources:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><b>Foursquare</b> - to get location data for the neighborhoods and existing Afghan restaurants. Foursquare provides data through an API, which I will make calls to in order to get data on venues in certain neighborhoods, as well as their location data. I can use this data to geolocate Afghan restaurants in Toronto in order to see if there are any areas that are saturated with them, or lacking them.</li>\n",
    "    <li><a href=\"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/geo?MM=1&geotext=Toronto,%20City%20%5BCensus%20subdivision%5D,%20Ontario&geocode=A00053520005\"><b>Canadian Census Wealth Data</b></a> - to get data on wealth indicators for Toronto to see if there is enough capital to support a business. As a wealth indicator I will be using home assessed values, which are strongly connected to the desirability and wealth of a neighborhood. Homes as assets are sources of wealth, and will be able to demonstrate areas where there is enough social capital to develop a restaurant. This data is provided online in machine readable formats, so I will probably use it as a CSV and enter it into pandas.</li>\n",
    "    <li><a href=\"https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/geo?geocode=S0503535&subject_levels=43&geotext=Toronto%20%5BCensus%20metropolitan%20area%5D%2C%20Ontario\"><b>Canadian Census Demographic Data</b></a> - to get information on where Afghans might be living in the Toronto area so as to figure out where a potential market for the business might be. This data provides numbers on ethnic groups in the Toronto area, so I will be able to utilize it to figure out what areas Afghans are living in. If I find a specific neighborhood, joined to this data, that has a high number of Afghan-Canadians then it would be considered a prime market for this restaurant.\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "This data will enable me to provide market analysis to find out if there is a neighborhood in Toronto that would be best for an Afghan restaurant. If there is not, this analysis will warn against such a decision."
